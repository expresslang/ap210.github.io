      <p>
         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis 
         for archiving.
         
      </p>
         
      <p>
              This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
              representation of the information needed to describe the different aspects of how components are joined together to make
         an assembly.  
         	 This module defines the information needed to describe the material used in making the physical connections and their typical
         shape.
         		This module is foundational for verification and validation that the actual design meets detailed functional specifications
         by
         		providing a mechanism for a design organization to make explicit assertions about the detailed joints that are implemented
         		in the physical design.
            
      </p>
      	 
      <p class="note"><small><a name="note_1">NOTE&nbsp;1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            The current edition of this part of ISO 10303 supports predefined bond shapes.  Bond material whose shape is defined in place
            can be represented using the capabilities of ISO/TS 10303-1032:2006.
            </small></p>
      
      
      	 
      <p class="note"><small><a name="note_2">NOTE&nbsp;2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            		 Joints that are asserted to be present in the design are mechanical views of the realized design at a detailed level.
            	 </small></p>
      	 
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_1">EXAMPLE&nbsp;1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            	A connector that is placed in an assembly using a coordinate transformation is a geometric representation of the relationship
            between
            		 the connector as a whole and the assembly it is helping to compose.  The transformation makes no assertions about the detailed
            		 relationships between the features of the connector and the other item or items in the assembly that it is mated with during
            the
            		 assembly realization process.  This module provides the ability to assert the relationship of each feature of that connector
            		 to a corresponding feature on a printed circuit board.  A application may use that set of asserted relationships to verify
            the
            		 connector actually connects what it is intended to connect.
            	 </small></p>
      	 
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_2">EXAMPLE&nbsp;2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            		 This module may be used to support the case where two daughter boards plug into a mother board to validate that the physical
            		 arrangment is a valid realization of the functional requirements for signal flow throughout the board set.
            	 </small></p>
      	 
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_3">EXAMPLE&nbsp;3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            		 The Application objects in this module may be used as part of a query for a function that validates that a footprint associated
            with a specific component whose
            		 reference designation is U33 is the correct footprint.
            	 </small></p>
      	 
      	 
      	
      <p>
         		This second edition of this part of ISO 10303 incorporates the modifications to the first edition listed below.
         	
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         		The following ARM EXPRESS declarations and interface specifications have been added:
         	
      </p>
      	
      <ul>
         		
         <li>bond_feature.</li>
         	
      </ul>
      	
      <p>
         		The following ARM EXPRESS declarations and interface specifications have been modified:
         	
      </p>
      	
      <ul>
         		
         <li>Assembly_bond_definition;</li>
         		
         <li>Assembly_joint;</li>
         		
         <li>Component_mating_constraint_condition.</li>
         	
      </ul>
      	
      <p>
         		In addition, modifications have been made to the mapping specification, 
         		the MIM schema and the EXPRESS-G diagrams to reflect and be consistent with the modifications of the ARM.
         	
      </p>
       
      <p>
         Clause <a href="1_scope.htm">1</a> defines the scope of the
         application module and summarizes the functionality and data covered. 
         
         Clause <a href="3_defs.htm">3</a> lists the words defined in
         this part of ISO 10303 and gives pointers to words defined elsewhere. 
         
         The information requirements of the application are specified in Clause 
         <a href="4_info_reqs.htm">4</a> using terminology appropriate to
         the application. 
         
         A graphical representation of the information requirements, referred to
         as the application reference model, is given in Annex 
         <a href="c_arm_expg.htm">C</a>. 
         
         Resource constructs are interpreted to meet the information
         requirements. 
         This interpretation produces the module interpreted model (MIM). 
         This interpretation, given in <a href="5_mapping.htm#mapping">5.1</a>,
         shows the correspondence between the information requirements and the
         MIM. The short listing of the MIM specifies the interface to the
         resources and is given in <a href="5_mim.htm#mim_express">5.2</a>.  
         
         A graphical representation of the short listing of the MIM is given
         in Annex <a href="d_mim_expg.htm">D</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         In this International Standard, the same English language words may be
         used to refer to an object in the real world or concept, and as the
         name of an EXPRESS data type that represents this object or concept. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The following typographical convention is used to distinguish between
         these. If a word or phrase occurs in the same typeface as narrative
         text, the referent is the object or concept. If the word or phrase
         occurs in a bold typeface or as a hyperlink, the referent is the
         EXPRESS data type. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The name of an EXPRESS data type may be used to refer to the data type
         itself, or to an instance of the data type. The distinction between
         these uses is normally clear from the context. If there is a likelihood
         of ambiguity, either the phrase "entity data type" or "instance(s) of" is
         included in the text. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Double quotation marks " " denote quoted text. Single quotation marks ' '
         denote particular text string values.
