      <p>
         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis 
         for archiving.
         
      </p>
      		
      <p>
         	This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of the data that identify 
         	and characterize products offered to market and of their components. This application module provides 
         	specifications suitable for the representation of any kind of such products. In particular, this application 
         	module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a great number of variants and 
         	whose composition is characterized due to the selection among a set of different product features. 
         	
      </p>
      		
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_">EXAMPLE&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            	Examples of such products are the products developed by the furniture industry, the automotive industry 
            	and the commercial airplane industry.
            	</small></p>
      		
      <p>
         	This application module specifies the data types and their constraints. It specifies the conformance class 
         	1 of ISO 10303-236.
         	
      </p>
      		
      <p>
         	A catalogue contains a list of references of different commercial products that are proposed to customers 
         	or to distributors. A catalogue provides a commercial view of the products of a supplier or manufacturer but 
         	it does not represent the design information of the commercial products.
         	
      </p>
      		
      <p>
         	It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.
         	
      </p>
      		
      <p>
         	The core of the product model is catalogue information. This information is connected to other parts in order 
         	to define the geometry of the products and to select a set of product features.
         	
      </p>
      		
      <p> 
         	This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalogue, such as the 
         	definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a product that the 
         	customer can chose in order to select one product from another). The structure of the product (the product 
         	itself or the decomposition of the product in its components), the effectivity of the catalogue itself or its 
         	products, the effectivity of the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives 
         	additional information about the product such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a 
         	classification of the products in order they could be found easily in a catalogue depending on different search 
         	criteria; the properties of the product (not selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing 
         	a catalogue specification in the <a href="../../../modules/product_class/sys/introduction.htm">ISO/TS 10303-1103</a> 
         	(Product class).
         	
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         Clause <a href="1_scope.htm">1</a> defines the scope of the
         application module and summarizes the functionality and data covered. 
         
         Clause <a href="3_defs.htm">3</a> lists the words defined in
         this part of ISO 10303 and gives pointers to words defined elsewhere. 
         
         The information requirements of the application are specified in Clause 
         <a href="4_info_reqs.htm">4</a> using terminology appropriate to
         the application. 
         
         A graphical representation of the information requirements, referred to
         as the application reference model, is given in Annex 
         <a href="c_arm_expg.htm">C</a>. 
         
         Resource constructs are interpreted to meet the information
         requirements. 
         This interpretation produces the module interpreted model (MIM). 
         This interpretation, given in <a href="5_mapping.htm#mapping">5.1</a>,
         shows the correspondence between the information requirements and the
         MIM. The short listing of the MIM specifies the interface to the
         resources and is given in <a href="5_mim.htm#mim_express">5.2</a>.  
         
         A graphical representation of the short listing of the MIM is given
         in Annex <a href="d_mim_expg.htm">D</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         In this International Standard, the same English language words may be
         used to refer to an object in the real world or concept, and as the
         name of an EXPRESS data type that represents this object or concept. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The following typographical convention is used to distinguish between
         these. If a word or phrase occurs in the same typeface as narrative
         text, the referent is the object or concept. If the word or phrase
         occurs in a bold typeface or as a hyperlink, the referent is the
         EXPRESS data type. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The name of an EXPRESS data type may be used to refer to the data type
         itself, or to an instance of the data type. The distinction between
         these uses is normally clear from the context. If there is a likelihood
         of ambiguity, either the phrase "entity data type" or "instance(s) of" is
         included in the text. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Double quotation marks " " denote quoted text. Single quotation marks ' '
         denote particular text string values.
