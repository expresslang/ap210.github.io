      <p>
         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis 
         for archiving.
         
      </p>
      		
      <p>
         			This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of various breakdowns of products.  
         			A breakdown is a partitioning of a product into a set of related elements to support engineering, analysis 
         			and other activities that can be performed in relation to the product.
         		
      </p>
      		
      <p>
         			The exact nature of a breakdown is determined by three different aspects of the breakdown:
         		
      </p>
      		
      <ul>
         			
         <li>The items that constitute the nodes or elements in the breakdown, including whether these are heterogeneous or homogeneous;</li>
         			
         <li>The interpretation placed on the relationships between the elements in the breakdown;</li>
         			
         <li>The rule set being followed by the creator of the breakdown.</li>
         		
      </ul>
      		
      <p>
         			This module does not place any constraints on these three aspects. 
         			However, there are specific types of breakdowns defined in other modules that specialise the entities provided in this
         module.
         			These breakdowns are explicit, parent-child views that are constrained to use homogeneous elements 
         			and therefore provide specific breakdown types:
         		
      </p>
      		
      <ul>
         			
         <li>functional [5];</li>
         			
         <li>physical [4];</li>
         			
         <li>system [3];</li>
         			
         <li>zonal [6].</li>
         			
         		
      </ul>
      		
      <p>
         			A breakdown can be asserted to be a Hybrid breakdown using the specialization described 
         			in [7]. Such a breakdown uses heterogeneous elements.
         		
      </p>
      
      		
      <p>
         			These views are complementary to the assembly structure and bill of materials views that are the primary focus for manufacturing
         
         			(realization) of a product [2]. 
         			Product breakdowns differ from such assembly structures in that the relationships between the nodes are often specific
         
         			to both the particular breakdown and the product or products to which the breakdown applies. 
         			In the case of an assembly structure the meaning of the relationships between components is 
         			always a variant of the idea of assembly and so any sub-tree can be used in multiple assemblies. 
         			A similar sub-tree of a product breakdown can only be applicable to the breakdown of the product in which it is defined.
         
         			The extent to which this is the case depends on the rule set followed by the creator of the breakdown.
         		
      </p>
      		
      <p>
         			Breakdowns can be of designs or realized individual products. For example, the functional breakdown of an individual product
         that 
         			has been damaged will be different to the functional breakdown of the design of that product type.
         			For any product, more than one breakdown can exist to support various different engineering activities.

         			The nature of the relationship between elements in the breakdown can also be refined by means of classification.

      <p>
         			This part of 10303 also supports the requirement to identify the product or relationship between products that is the realization

         Clause <a href="1_scope.htm">1</a> defines the scope of the

         The information requirements of the application are specified in Clause 
         <a href="4_info_reqs.htm">4</a> using terminology appropriate to
         the application. 
         
         A graphical representation of the information requirements, referred to

         In this International Standard, the same English language words may be
         used to refer to an object in the real world or concept, and as the
         name of an EXPRESS data type that represents this object or concept. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The following typographical convention is used to distinguish between
         these. If a word or phrase occurs in the same typeface as narrative
         text, the referent is the object or concept. If the word or phrase
         occurs in a bold typeface or as a hyperlink, the referent is the
         EXPRESS data type. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The name of an EXPRESS data type may be used to refer to the data type
         itself, or to an instance of the data type. The distinction between
         these uses is normally clear from the context. If there is a likelihood
         of ambiguity, either the phrase "entity data type" or "instance(s) of" is
         included in the text.
