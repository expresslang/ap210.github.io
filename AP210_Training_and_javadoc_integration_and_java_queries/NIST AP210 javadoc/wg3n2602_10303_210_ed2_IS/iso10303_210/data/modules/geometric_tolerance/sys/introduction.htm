      <p>
         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis 
         for archiving.
         
      </p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the definition of geometric tolerances.  
      <p> Geometric tolerances are used in the specification of a feature of the shape of a product.  A geometric tolerance defines
         a tolerance zone, which is a region in space in which the feature must lie.  The shape of the zone depends upon the kind of
         tolerance and feature.
          
      </p>
       
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_1">EXAMPLE&nbsp;1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
             A flatness tolerance zone is bounded by two parallel planes.</small></p>
       
      <p>The tolerance is a length measure that is a size dimension of the tolerance zone.
          
      </p>
       
      <p>Geometric tolerances of form  be used to control the form of an individual feature.    Tolerances of form include flatness,
         straightness, cylindricity, and roundness also called circularity.  The tolerance zone of a tolerance of form is not related
         to any other features and may be in any location or orientation.  Tolerances of form may be applied to elements of a feature.
      </p>
       
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_2">EXAMPLE&nbsp;2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            A flatness tolerance may require only that a feature is locally flat throughout.  The tolerance applies to any restricted
            region of a certain size.</small></p>
      <p>       
          Geometric tolerances may control the location or orientation of a feature in relationship to others.  In this case, the tolerance
         zone is disposed about the theoretically exact location of the feature it controls, relative to a datum system. 
      </p>
       
      <p>    A datum system defines a Cartesian coordinate system that is sufficient to locate and orient the tolerance zone.  The
         datum system is constructed from features, called datum features of the part.  Datums are normally points, lines, and planes
         that are derived from datum features, or from restricted regions called targets.  Datums may lie on the surface or on a centre
         of symmetry of a feature of size.  Features of size are symmetrical about a point, line or plane and have a size dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_3">EXAMPLE&nbsp;3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            A hole is a feature of size with a centre line.</small></p>
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_4">EXAMPLE&nbsp;4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The two opposing surfaces of a slot form a feature of size with a centre plane.</small></p>
       
      <p>A datum system need not be a complete coordinate system.   It provides sufficient datums  to uniquely locate the tolerance
         zone.  The number of datums that is required, depends on the kind of datum features and toleranced features and their theoretically
         exact spatial relationship. 
      </p>
       
      <p>The theoretically exact location of the toleranced  feature relative to the datum system is obtained either directly query
         of the geometric model of the shape,  or from explicit instances of geometric dimensions. In either case, the dimensions must
         be distinguished as theoretically exact either by designation or by convention.
      </p>
       
      <p>Tolerances of location include position, concentricity, coaxiality, and symmetry. Tolerances of  orientation include  angularity,
         and its special cases parallelism and perpendicularity.
      </p>
       
      <p>Tolerances of position control the location of features of size. The tolerance of a Position tolerance may vary depending
         on whether the size of the feature departs from its greatest or least allowed size. 
      </p>  
      <p> Position tolerances may be applied simultaneously to patterns, and composite position tolerances can be applied to further
         refine the relative locations   among the features of the pattern.
      </p>
       
      <p>The method of deriving the datum  from the imperfect features of a workpiece may be deliberately left indeterminate, so as
         minimize the needless rejection of parts.  In this case, any of a set of candidate datums may be used to locate the tolerance
         zone.
      </p>
      <p class="example"><small><a name="example_5">EXAMPLE&nbsp;5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            A hole is larger than its required minimum can float when used as a datum feature. </small></p>
       
      <p>Tolerances of profile control the outline of a feature in a plane of projection or cross section.  Profile tolerances may
         be applied with or without reference to a datum system. Profile tolerances may control form, orientation, and location depending
         on how they are applied.  Profile tolerances include profile of a line, and profile of a surface.
      </p>
       
      <p>Runout tolerances are composite tolerances that control a feature relative to a datum  axis. Runout tolerances include circular
         runout and total   runout.
      </p>
       
      <p>Geometric tolerance and datum specifications are interpreted according to the algorithms of external standards, such as ISO
         1101,  which must be referenced for the  tolerance to be well defined.   The means of referencing the standards for a particular
         product definition is  not provided in this part of ISO 10303.
      </p>

         Clause <a href="1_scope.htm">1</a> defines the scope of the
         application module and summarizes the functionality and data covered. 
         
         Clause <a href="3_defs.htm">3</a> lists the words defined in
         this part of ISO 10303 and gives pointers to words defined elsewhere. 
         
         The information requirements of the application are specified in Clause 
         <a href="4_info_reqs.htm">4</a> using terminology appropriate to
         the application. 
         
         A graphical representation of the information requirements, referred to
         as the application reference model, is given in Annex 
         <a href="c_arm_expg.htm">C</a>. 
         
         Resource constructs are interpreted to meet the information
         requirements. 
         This interpretation produces the module interpreted model (MIM). 
         This interpretation, given in <a href="5_mapping.htm#mapping">5.1</a>,
         shows the correspondence between the information requirements and the
         MIM. The short listing of the MIM specifies the interface to the
         resources and is given in <a href="5_mim.htm#mim_express">5.2</a>.  
         
         A graphical representation of the short listing of the MIM is given
         in Annex <a href="d_mim_expg.htm">D</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         In this International Standard, the same English language words may be
         used to refer to an object in the real world or concept, and as the
         name of an EXPRESS data type that represents this object or concept. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The following typographical convention is used to distinguish between
         these. If a word or phrase occurs in the same typeface as narrative
         text, the referent is the object or concept. If the word or phrase
         occurs in a bold typeface or as a hyperlink, the referent is the
         EXPRESS data type. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The name of an EXPRESS data type may be used to refer to the data type
         itself, or to an instance of the data type. The distinction between
         these uses is normally clear from the context. If there is a likelihood
         of ambiguity, either the phrase "entity data type" or "instance(s) of" is
         included in the text. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Double quotation marks " " denote quoted text. Single quotation marks ' '
         denote particular text string values.
